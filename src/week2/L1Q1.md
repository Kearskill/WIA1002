My name is Kearney with matrix number, 23001894. I am majoring in computer 
science (artificial intelligence). This is my 1st time taking the Data Structure
subject. At the moment, I am feeling dreadful about taking this
subject. This is because leetcode. I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 
course. It’s not too bad. So, I think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject
this term. In order to do well in the subject, I will leetcode. Wish me luck.
```

1. Create a text file that introduces you to me. Name this file as yourname_matrixNum.txt (i.e.,
   JamesBond_U1234567.txt). The content of the first part of your letter can be adapted from
   the example given above. (However, you are free to write on your own, so long you retain
   the information). Write/type directly on a Notepad and save them as a text file format (.txt).


2. Create a program to read the file (yourname_matrixNum.txt). Display the contents of the file
   in the output console. [Project name : ReadMyLetter_matrixNum]

**Part 2:**

You will append your letter (from part one) with a second part of the letter dated the day of the
last lab session of DS (Thursday, 18 June 2021). Assuming you fast forward to the future, reflect
and describe:

- How you have performed in the class?
- Are you happy with your performance?
- What has learning DS taught you / what did you learn from DS?
- Is there any change to your target grade? 
- What you did well during the course?
- What could have been done better during the course?

`so this should be the future me?`


3. Write the second part of the letter using the input from Console (Do not type on the txt file
   directly). To do this, you are required to modify your program above (2) by importing a
   Scanner class to read input from the keyboard. Your description outlined above should be
   appended (not overwritten) to the first part of your letter. Display the contents of the letter
   (part 1 and part 2) in the output console. The final letter should be something like below:
   ```

   My name is XXXX (your name) with matrix number, XXXXX (your matrix number). I am
   majoring in XXXX (your majoring). This is my first/second/third (specify) time taking the
   Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling XXXX(your emotion) about taking this
   subject. This is because XXXX (describe the cause of your emotion about taking DS).
   I acquired XXXX (your grade) for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I
   think I can manage to get XXXX (the expected grade) for this DS subject this term. In order
   to do well in the subject, I will XXXX (what will you do). Wish me luck!!!

   It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did
   XXX (your performance) in this course. ……….

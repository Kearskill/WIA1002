2. What is the output for the following? Explain.

```declarative
class Person {
    public Person() {
        System.out.println("(1) Performs Person's tasks");
    }
}

class Employee extends Person {
    public Employee() {
        this("(2) Invoke Employee's overloaded constructor");
        System.out.println("(3) Performs Employee's tasks ");
    }

    public Employee(String s) {
        System.out.println(s);
    }
}

public class Faculty extends Employee {
    public Faculty() {
        System.out.println("(4) Performs Faculty's tasks"); 
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Faculty();
    }
}
```

From psvm (driver class), we can observe it starts from Faculty instance.

Faculty instance calls Employee instance (super class) before executing inside, so number 4 is on hold.

Employee instance calls Person instance (super class of Employee)

Person instance is the grandmother of classes, so it prints that out first (message 1)

After that, the process goes back to Employee, and Employee `this(message)` call its own instance to print out String s (message 2), and prints out third (message 3)

Finally it goes back to Faculty instance, and last message is printed (message 4)

The order goes `1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4`

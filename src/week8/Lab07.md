**<ins>Lab 7: Graph</ins>**<br>

1. The addEdge method in WeightedGraph.java adds only directed edges. Create an
   addUndirectedEdge method that creates undirected edges. This method receives two vertices
   and a weight and return a boolean

```java

```

2. Create a method removeEdge that removes an edge if the source and destination of the edge
   is given.
```java


```

3. We do not need weighted graphs all the time. Based on the framework of the weighted
   graph12, create a class Graph.java for unweighted graphs. Implement both addEdge and
   addUndirectedEdge methods.

```java

```

4. Modify the TestWeightedGraph.java in the lecture notes to test the Graph class created in
   question 3.

```java

```

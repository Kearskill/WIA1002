   priority queue using its ADT. Then, perform the following operations to the priority
   queue:
- toString() - Display all the elements inside this priority queue.
- poll() – retrieve and remove the first element in this priority queue.
- add() – add new element 5 into the priority queue
- toArray() – convert the priority queue into an array and display.
- peek() – retrieve the first element in the priority queue.
- contains() – check if the priority queue consists of element “1”.
- size() – get the current size of the priority queue.
- isEmpty() – display while removing the elements in the queue until it is empty.
- Sort the priority queue in reversing order
